* framework
** frameworks require a testsuite for variable subsitution, tests need to reflect that
** process-command is kind of squirrely. It will merge a command string list and then split it again
** check that the process is set to the right buffer currently it is set to (current-buffer)
** process-filters second arguement is a list of strings
** pass process-status to build and run filters
** Framework should probably be set at the ut-conf level not at the individual test-suite level
