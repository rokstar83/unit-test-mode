* framework
** frameworks require a testsuite for variable subsitution, tests need to reflect that
** process-command is kind of squirrely. It will merge a command string list and then split it again
** check that the process is set to the right buffer currently it is set to (current-buffer)
** process-filters second arguement is a list of strings
** pass process-status to build and run filters
** Framework should probably be set at the ut-conf level not at the individual test-suite level

** TODO %project-dir% is not being expanded because it isn't part of the test-suite hashtable
** TODO ut-framework-new-test-suite-hook should probably take the ut-conf as well as the test-suite
** TODO ut-test-suite-p is looking for ut-test-suite-run-command to be defined as either a string of function
** TODO ut-draw-buffer and ut both use with-current-buffer, doesn't hurt anything but is redundent
** TODO ut-build-test-suite
*** ut-buffer-p is not defined but called
*** ut-get-test-suite-at-point is not defined but called
*** interactive call dumps if not in ut-buffer, probably should ask for input from user instead
** TODO ut-draw-test-suite needs a lot of work, need to hash out summarize features as well as test-suite status
** TODO weird glitch in flycheck on ut-define-framework, functionp doesn't appear to be working, 
   could be a temp file issue investigate further.
** DONE adding a test asks for the framework, which it should just inherit from the conf
** DONE adding AC_CONFIG_FILES for the test directory doesn't appear to be automatic for some reason
** DONE new cunit tests don't add AC_CONFIG_FILES to configure.ac (tests/${TEST-SUITE}/Makefile, tests/${TEST-SUITE}/src/Makefile
** TODO Makefile.am for new test uses absolute path with ~/ unexpanded, need to change to relative back path
   Current solution is a bit hackish.
** DONE Makefile.am in ${test-suite}/src/ using camel case instead of snake case for cunit
** DONE Wrong path for cunit-sexp-outputer include and lib
